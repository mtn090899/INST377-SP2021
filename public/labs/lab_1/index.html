<h1>Matthew Nguyen's Internet Page</h1>

First, the basics.

<h2>The Basics</h2>

<p>
    Headings set your default page size
</p>

<img src="mochi.png"> <img src="mochi.svg"> <img src="mochi.jpg"> <img src="mochi.gif">

<p>Add your four mochi image s from your tutorial here. </p>

<h2>Lists</h2>

Let's make an unordered list.

<ul>
<li>HTML/CSS underpins most user interface now</li>
<li>CSS tries something so hard no other computer language even bothers</li>
<li>Javascript got popular from having a runtime in ever browser in the world</li>
</ul>

And now, one in order.

<p> DISCLAIMER: <em>Despite</em> this being in a ordered list, this is not in particular order 
    because I have not fully listened through any of these albums except maybe one or two.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Ray Charles ultimate collection</li>
    <li>Thriller</li>
    <li>By my side</li>
    <li>Best of Yoshida Brothers</li>
    <li>Stevie Wonder the Definitive Collection</li>
</ol>

<h2>Inline elements</h2>

<p>Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention</em> to something in a line of text.</p>
<p>Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize</strong> something in the text.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sometimes you want to do both.</strong></em></p>

<h2>Empty Elements</h2>

<p>Soft line breaks can't wrap anything.<br> Neither can image tags, or hard lines.</p>

<p>Add a hard line under here.</p>

<p>This page probably doesn't look great - we'll learn how to hook it to CSS next week.</p>
